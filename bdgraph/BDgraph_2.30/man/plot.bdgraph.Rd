\title{ Plot function for \code{S3} class \code{"bdgraph"} }

\description{ Visualizes structure of the selected graphs which could be a graph with links for which their estimated posterior probabilities are greater than 0.5
or graph with the highest posterior probability. }

\usage{ \method{plot}{bdgraph}( x, cut = 0.5, number.g = 1, layout = layout.circle, ... ) }

\arguments{
  \item{x}{ An object of \code{S3} class \code{"bdgraph"}, from function \code{\link{bdgraph}}. }
  
  \item{cut}{ Threshold for including the links in the selected graph based on the estimated posterior probabilities of the links; See the examples. } 

  \item{number.g}{ The number of graphs with the highest probabilities (default is 1).}
  
  \item{layout}{The vertex placement algorithm which is according to \pkg{igraph} package. The default is \code{"layout.circle"}.}
  
  \item{\dots}{System reserved (no specific usage).}
