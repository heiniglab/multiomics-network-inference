\title{Sampling from complex G-Wishart distribution}

\description{
Generates random matrices, distributed according to the complex G-Wishart distribution with parameters b and D, \eqn{CW_G(b, D)}.
}

\usage{ rgcwish( n = 1, adj.g = NULL, b = 3, D = NULL ) }

\arguments{
  \item{n}{The number of samples required. }
  \item{adj.g}{
    The adjacency matrix corresponding to the graph structure. It should be an upper triangular matrix in which \eqn{a_{ij}=1} 
    if there is a link between notes \eqn{i}{i} and \eqn{j}{j}, otherwise \eqn{a_{ij}=0}.
    }
  \item{b}{The degree of freedom for complex G-Wishart distribution, \eqn{CW_G(b, D)}. }
  \item{D}{The positive definite \eqn{(p \times p)} "scale" matrix for complex G-Wishart distribution, \eqn{CW_G(b, D)}. 
           The default is an identity matrix.}
}

\details{
Sampling from the complex G-Wishart distribution, \eqn{K \sim CW_G(b, D)}, with density:

  \deqn{Pr(K) \propto |K| ^ {b} \exp \left\{- \mbox{trace}(K \times D)\right\},}

which \eqn{b > 2} is the degree of freedom and D is a symmetric positive definite matrix.
}

\value{
A numeric array, say A, of dimension \eqn{(p \times p \times n)}, where each \eqn{A[,,i]}{A[,,i]} is a positive 
definite matrix, a realization of the complex G-Wishart distribution, \eqn{CW_G(b, D)}.
