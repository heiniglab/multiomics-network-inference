\title{	Search algorithm in graphical models }
\description{
	As the main function of the \pkg{BDgraph} package, 
	this function consists of several sampling algorithms for Bayesian model determination in undirected graphical models. % based on birth-death MCMC method. 
	To speed up the computations, the birth-death MCMC sampling algorithms are implemented in parallel using \pkg{OpenMP} in \code{C++}.
}
\usage{
bdgraph( data, n = NULL, method = "ggm", algorithm = "bdmcmc", iter = 5000, 
         burnin = iter / 2, g.start = "empty", g.space = NULL, prior.df = 3, 
         multi.update = NULL, save.all = FALSE, print = 1000 )
}

\arguments{
	\item{data}{
	There are two options: (1) an (\eqn{n \times p}) matrix or a \code{data.frame} corresponding to the data, 
	(2) an (\eqn{p \times p}) covariance matrix as \eqn{S=X'X} which \eqn{X} is the data matrix 
	(\eqn{n} is the sample size and \eqn{p} is the number of variables). 
	It also could be an object of class \code{"sim"}, from function \code{\link{bdgraph.sim}}.
	The input matrix is automatically identified by checking the symmetry.
	}

	\item{n}{The number of observations. It is needed if the \code{"data"} is a covariance matrix.}
	  
	\item{method}{
		A character with two options \code{"ggm"} (defult) and \code{"gcgm"}. 
		Option \code{"ggm"} is for Gaussian graphical models based on Gaussianity assumption.
		Option \code{"gcgm"} is for Gaussian copula graphical models for the data that not follow Gaussianity assumption (e.g. continuous non-Gaussian, discrete, or mixed dataset).
	}

	\item{algorithm}{
		A character with two options \code{"bdmcmc"} (defult) and \code{"rjmcmc"}. 
		Option \code{"bdmcmc"} is based on birth-death MCMC algorithm.
		Option \code{"rjmcmc"} is based on reverible jump MCMC algorithm.
	}
	
	\item{iter}{The number of iteration for the sampling algorithm.}
	\item{burnin}{The number of burn-in iteration for the sampling algorithm.}

	\item{g.start}{
		Corresponds to a starting point of the graph. It could be \code{"empty"} (default) and \code{"full"}. 
		Option \code{"empty"} means the initial graph is an empty graph and \code{"full"} means a full graph. 
		It also could be an object with \code{S3} class \code{"bdgraph"}; 
		with this option we could run the sampling algorithm from the last objects of previous run (see examples).     
	} 
	\item{g.space}{
		Corresponds to the sub-space of the graph. 
		For the case \code{ g.start = "NULL"} (defult), algorithm search in the hole graph space. 
		With this option, one could run the search algorithm only to the restricted subspace of the graph.
		Subspace should determine as an adjacency matrix.
	} 

	\item{prior.df}{
		The degree of freedom for G-Wishart distribution, \eqn{W_G(b,D)}, which is a prior distribution of the precision matrix.
	}
	\item{multi.update}{
		It is only for the BDMCMC algorithm (\code{algorithm = "bdmcmc"}).
		It is for simultaneously updating multiple links at the same time to update graph in the BDMCMC algorithm.
	}	
	\item{save.all}{
		Logical: if FALSE (default), the adjacency matrices are NOT saved. 
		If TRUE, the adjacency matrices after burn-in are saved.
	}
	\item{print}{ Value to see the number of iteration for the MCMC algorithm. }	
}

\value{
	An object with \code{S3} class \code{"bdgraph"} is returned:
	
	\item{p_links}{ An upper triangular matrix which corresponds the estimated posterior probabilities of all possible links. }
	
	\item{K_hat}{ The posterior estimation of the precision matrix. }
	
	For the case "save.all = TRUE" is returned:

	\item{sample_graphs}{ A vector of strings which includes the adjacency matrices of visited graphs after burn-in.}
	\item{graph_weights}{ A vector which includes the waiting times of visited graphs after burn-in. }

	\item{all_graphs}{A vector which includes the identity of the adjacency matrices for all iterations after burn-in. 
		  It is needed for monitoring the convergence of the BD-MCMC algorithm.}

	\item{all_weights}{A vector which includes the waiting times for all iterations after burn-in. 
	                   It is needed for monitoring the convergence of the BD-MCMC algorithm.}
