\title{ Bayesian Structure Learning in Graphical Models }

\description{
The \code{R} package \pkg{BDgraph} provides statistical tools for Bayesian structure learning in undirected graphical models. %based on birth-death MCMC method.      
The package is implemented the recent improvements in the Bayesian literature, including Mohammadi and Wit (2015) and Mohammadi et al. (2015).
The computationally intensive tasks of the package is implemented in \code{C++} and interfaced with \code{R}, to speed up the computations. 
Besides, the package contains several functions for simulation and visualization, as well as two multivariate datasets taken from the literature.
}
\details{
The package includes 10 main functions:
