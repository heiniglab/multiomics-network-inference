\title{ Graph selection }

\description{
Provides the selected graph which, based on input, could be a graph with links for which their estimated posterior probabilities are greater than 0.5 (default)
or a graph with the highest posterior probability; see examples.
%For more specific selection of graphs consult the 'prob' function.  
}

\usage{ select( bdgraph.obj, cut = NULL, vis = FALSE ) }

\arguments{
  \item{bdgraph.obj}{ An object of \code{S3} class \code{"bdgraph"}, from function \code{\link{bdgraph}}. }
  \item{cut}{ Threshold for including the links in the selected graph based on the estimated posterior probabilities of the links; see the examples. }  
  \item{vis}{ Visualize the selected graph structure. }
}

\value{	\item{G}{ An adjacency matrix corresponding to the selected graph.} }
